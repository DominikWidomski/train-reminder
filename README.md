# Train Reminder
Simple Google Chrome extension that would suggest to me when a good time to leave the office would be, based on train arrival times, the routes and my location.

## Milestones

* Basic functionality, getting right data to provide journey suggestion
* Visuals (style, views, animations, etc.)
* When the code fires (alerts etc)
* Improve JS templating
* What can I test?
* Build process (JS modules, compile SCSS, JS templating, create correct HTML files etc)
